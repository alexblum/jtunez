... is a music player, that can be controlled over network.
The intended typical usage is to remote control a raspberry pi (tm) with a plugged speaker via any browser.

A not-so-far-fetched use case is: laying in bed, using the phone to activate music that comes from a distance that is greater than from-bed-reachable ;-)


What it does by now:
- scan local folders for music, and store information about it
- random play local music
- stream web radio

What is new implemented, but still under construction:
- adjust the volume
- provide a list of possible webradio streams to choose from


That's it. It may not be much, but I liked the idea of doing it myself, and to play around with jetty and stuff :)
